What is Regression Analysis?
Regression analysis is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It helps in predicting outcomes, identifying trends, and understanding the impact of various factors on a given outcome.

Why Do We Use Regression Analysis?
Regression analysis is used to: Predict future values based on historical data.
Understand relationships between variables.
Identify important factors affecting the outcome.
Make informed decisions based on data trends.

What Do We Get from Using Regression Analysis?
By using regression analysis, we gain: Accurate predictions of outcomes. Insights into the strength and nature of relationships between variables. A better understanding of the data and the ability to make data-driven decisions.

1. Linear Regression Definition:
Models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables using a straight
line.

Use Case: Used when the relationship between variables is linear. Commonly used in finance, economics, and biology for
predicting continuous outcomes. Example:
Predicting housing prices based on square footage.

2. Logistic Regression Definition:
Used for binary classification, modeling the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category.

Use Case: Useful for classification problems such as predicting whether an email is spam or not, or whether a customer will make
a purchase. Example: Predicting if a customer will buy a product (yes/no)

3. Polynomial Regression Definition:
Extends linear regression by fitting a polynomial curve to the data, allowing for a non-linear relationship between
variables.

Use Case: Effective when the data shows a curvilinear relationship. Used in scenarios like modeling the growth of a population or sales trends over time.
Example: Modeling the growth rate of a species
population over time.

4. Ridge Regression Definition:
A type of linear regression that includes a regularization term to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients.
Swipe for more

Use Case: Ideal when there are many features, and
multicollinearity (correlation between independent variables) is a concern.
Example: Predicting stock prices with multiple
correlated financial indicators.

5. Lasso Regression Definition:
Similar to ridge regression but can shrink some coefficients to zero, effectively selecting a subset of
features.
Swipe for more

Use Case: Useful for feature selection when dealing with high-dimensional data, reducing the number of variables in the
model. Example: Selecting the most important factors affecting house prices.
